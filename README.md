Python example showing a simple hello world function to be used in OpenIAP's serverless platform.
When running locally you can add an `SF_TAG` environment variable to the .env file and see it change when you access the webserver on http://localhost:3000
When deployed in OpenCore, this will automatically contain the current `TAG` ( version ) of you application.
